# HWIDGEN Souce Code

This project provides the source code of the popular HWIDGEN Windows activation "tool" (it's basically a script compiled as .exe binary). A discussion around the source code can be found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/d654al/contribution_hwidgen_source_code/).


## Credits
* The credit goes to the original author of HWIDGEN - slave. 
* All contributors for this project which helped to reveal the source code. 


## License
This project has no real license (unlicensed) since I'm not the original developer of "HWIDGEN". This project only provides the information and the files to show how the script works.


## Project Goal
* Releasing the full source code of HWIDGEN
* Provide compiler & decompiler instructions
* Show/provide the external tools which are been used by HWIDGEN


## Why isn't the original HWIDGEN tool open source'd?
There are multiple reasons, the original author slave has another opinion on open sourcing programs than I have. He believes keeping the source closed will prevent people from stealing his work. Keep in mind that I do not stole his work here, I just provide the code because refused it (many times) to open. He got several time asked e.g. on Reddit, Nsane to realease the source and he (still) refuses it, so let's decompile it and show the world how his script works.

### Personal comment
I believe publishing the source code is overall a good thing for everyone because it levels the playing field. White hats, "cracker" or other people want to know about the current Windows activation holes and I don''t think that ["security through obscurity"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) is the way to go. Most people simply want to learn from Windows exploits/holes. It also helps to find new strategies and holes in case Microsoft modifies/patches something.


## Isn't it dangerous to open source it, now Microsoft can learn from it and close the hole!
* Microsoft certainly has some anti-piracy measures in place e.g. Windows Home Server never got cracked (there is only a trial reset), so if Microsoft really wants to shutdown something or prevent someone from activating the OS they "could", no matter if the activation program is closed or open sourced. 
* Microsoft makes (similar to Intel) most money with Server Hardware/OS, not the desktop consumer market, that does not mean they don't care about "the little ones" but the prioorities are just different. 
* Microsoft is already well aware of all activation "tricks", most source is already on GitHub, GitLab & Co. Some holes like KMS simply can't be easily shutdown without hurting the OEM customers.
